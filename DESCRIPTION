Description: Calculates first, and second order, average minimal depth of a
    maximal subtree for a forest object produced by the R 'ranger'
    package. This variable importance metric is implemented as described in
    Ishwaran et. al. ("High-Dimensional Variable Selection for Survival Data",
    March 2010, <doi:10.1198/jasa.2009.tm08622>).
